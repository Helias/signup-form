## How to install


### Requirements

To run the application you need to have installed  **Nodejs & npm**.
To install them you can easily follow [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) of the official nodejs website.

The guide provides you all the details for several Linux distros, for Windows and Mac.

### Installation

Once you have installed the requirements you can install the software dependencies using the package manager `npm` in the following way:
```
npm install
```

### Start the application

Well, now you are available to run the application using the `ng` tool with the following command:
```
ng serve -o
```

The `-o` parameter is optional, it will open you the web application in your browser automatically but you can also avoid it and open it manually.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
